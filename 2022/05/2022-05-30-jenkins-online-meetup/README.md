# Kickstarting CI Best Practices with Jenkins in Autonomous Teams - Online Meetup

When developing a project, there are many things to consider.
It's not just about the code itself, but also about building, testing and packaging everything.
Making this process easier is the main goal for the Engineering Productivity teams at Dynatrace.

Join us in this talk to learn about how we are utilizing Jenkins to ease the process of building and delivering applications for hundreds of developers.
You'll see how our Jenkins instances are running in a Kubernetes cluster, how they are provisioned via Configuration as Code with minimal overhead 
and which tools are used to get the most out of our workflow.
Additionally, we'll add a live demo to show how all of these components can work together.

Speakers:

- Katharina Sick, Software Engineer at Dynatrace. Full stack software engineer at Dynatrace. Advanced from mobile to backend development and now putting more focus on full stack solutions as well as CI and CD environments.
- Martin Singer, Software Engineer at Dynatrace. Working on CI/CD topics since starting as a full time software engineer. Always eager to learn about new ways to automate processes.
